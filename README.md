# KinectDAQ
## ME421 | Winter 2011/12

A simple .NET application that takes in data from the Kinect (video and audio location data) as well as serial data sent by an arduino.

The goal of the experiment it to see determine the accuracy of the Kinect's beamforming algorithms and if the device itself could accurately localize a moving object. In our case, the object is a continuously talking audio source moving back and forth on a conveyor belt.
